         <h3> Why these Hobbies?</h3>
         <ol> 
            <li> I love playing video games because this is my outlet of stress. Where I can relax and I don't think much about anything while playing. Video Games help me to enhance my skills for analyzing, calculating, thinking creatively, and more. Most of the Video games I play are more lean to strategic games like Tower defense games and Competitive shooting games.
            </li>
            <li>I find playing sports really fun and interesting because I am strong and can withstand anything that hits me. I can play basketball really well but I'm not an expert nor a pro but I am sure that I am effective when playing basketball. Not only do I play basketball but I can also play badminton, volleyball, and soccer. I find playing various sports very fun and interesting especially when you are playing well. Having to think about your gameplay and what to execute on a court makes me wanna play again.
            </li>
            <li> Coding and programming is my second experience. My First encounter with coding is when I was in Grade 3 where we use HTML to make a website and for Programming I was also In grade 3 when I first encountered programming. I was programming a series of lights where I have to make them light up in sequence. Now this year I find it very interesting and it's making me curious. For coding I am still trying to process every lesson that is taught by us since now we use applications that will further make our coding experience easy. For programming I find it very easy and interesting as well since I am fond of typing manually and trouble shooting my work. I can see what I did wrong and how I can further improve my work.

      <h3> Why these Skills?</h3>
      <ol> 
        <li> I find multitasking as my skill because I can do a lot of things at the same time. For example I'm doing my homework at the same time I'm washing the dishes while cleaning the table. I like doing because doing it all at the same time is challenging and when you're all done doing the tasks that's been giving to you all at the same time it makes me satisfied that I have done the work and finished the work all at the same time.
        </li>
        <li>My programming skill is not a level of a pro but I am able to understand and pick up how to do programming and what it does.
        </li>
        <li>Since I was 5 years old I am already good at dealing with tech, since My mom is a boomer I am only capable of teaching her how to use and fix her tech or gadgets. It satksfy me when I am able to fix something complicated.
        </li>
